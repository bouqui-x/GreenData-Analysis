## Introduction
The Global Sustainable Energy project analyzes comprehensive energy and economic data from 176 countries worldwide between 2000 and 2020 to uncover critical insights into renewable energy adoption, electricity access patterns, and the relationship between sustainable energy development and economic growth. This interactive dashboard examines energy infrastructure, GDP correlations, and renewable energy capacity across different regions, with a particular focus on African nations and their energy transition progress.

This project looks at how countries around the world use and produce energy. It focuses on access to electricity, use of renewable (clean) energy, dependence on fossil fuels and COâ‚‚ emissions and pollution.

## Key Metrics Tracked
- Total Countries Analyzed: 176 nations with comprehensive energy data
- Average GDP Growth Rate: Economic performance indicators across regions
- GDP Per Capita Analysis: Economic development correlation with energy access
- Renewable Energy Capacity: Average RE generating capacity by country
- Electricity Access Rates: Population coverage and infrastructure development
- Clean Fuel Access: Household access to clean cooking and heating solutions
- Regional Performance Comparison: Africa vs Non-African energy development patterns

#### Data source: Kaggle
#### Tools Used: Power BI, Excel, Power Query Editor

## Analysis 
### Electricity Access and Economic Development
The dashboard reveals a strong correlation between electricity access rates and GDP growth across the 176 countries analyzed. Countries with higher electricity access (approaching 100%) demonstrate more stable economic growth patterns, while nations with limited access show greater volatility in GDP performance.

### Renewable Energy Capacity Distribution
Analysis shows significant variation in renewable energy generating capacity, with an average of 113.14 units across all countries. Leading nations like Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, Niger, and Bhutan demonstrate substantial renewable energy infrastructure, indicating successful clean energy transition strategies.

### Regional Energy Divide
The Africa vs Non-African comparison reveals a 48.7% to 51.3% split in GDP per capita distribution, highlighting the ongoing energy equity challenges. African nations show diverse electricity usage patterns, with some countries achieving significant progress while others remain below global averages.

### Electricity Usage Trends (2000-2020)
Time series analysis of minimum and maximum electricity usage reveals:
- Steady Growth: Countries like South Africa and Ghana show consistent upward trends
- Volatile Patterns: Nations such as Somalia and Uganda display more irregular usage patterns
- Infrastructure Gaps: Significant disparities between minimum and maximum usage indicate uneven distribution networks

### Clean Fuel Access Disparities
The horizontal bar chart analysis shows dramatic variations in clean fuel access:
- Developed Nations: Canada, UAE, UK, and US achieve near 100% access rates
- Developing Regions: Brazil and South Africa show moderate access (75-85%)
- Infrastructure Challenges: Many African nations demonstrate significant gaps in clean fuel accessibility

### Renewable Energy Overview Patterns
The scatter plot analysis indicates that countries with higher renewable energy shares in total consumption tend to have more sustainable long-term energy strategies, though this doesn't always correlate directly with immediate economic indicators.

## Recommendations and Conclusions  
The world is making measurable progress in renewable energy adoption, with global capacity increasing significantly over the past decade. However, many countries are still falling behind, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, creating a widening energy equity gap.
Countries must balance short-term needs such as basic electricity access and energy security with long-term clean energy transformation goals. This requires phased approaches that prioritize universal access while simultaneously building renewable energy capacity.

With the right actions and sustained commitment, the data suggests that universal access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy is achievable. Success depends on coordinated efforts between governments, international organizations, private sector stakeholders, and civil society to ensure everyone - no matter where they live - can access sustainable energy solutions.

*This analysis contributes to understanding global energy sustainability challenges and opportunities, supporting the energy access gap through financial incentives, and international cooperation while maintaining focus on long-term sustainability goals.*
